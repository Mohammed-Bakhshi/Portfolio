# Digital Portfolio  

Welcome to my **Digital Portfolio**! This project showcases my technical skills, hobbies, and passion for technology, highlighting my expertise as a **Full Stack Developer**.  

## About the Project  

I created this portfolio to provide an engaging and interactive way to share my journey in technology. Built with modern tools and a strong focus on **UI/UX**, this application demonstrates my capabilities in both **front-end** and **back-end** development.  

### Key Features  

- **Built with React.js**  
  A fast and dynamic front-end framework for building user interfaces.  

- **Hosted on AWS EC2**  
  Ensures reliability, scalability, and speed for seamless performance.  

- **Custom Domain with SSL**  
  The app is secured with an SSL certificate, providing users with a secure browsing experience.  

- **Nginx and Node.js Deployment**  
  Efficiently deployed using Nginx as a reverse proxy and Node.js to serve the app.  

- **Modern and Animated Design**  
  Sleek, smooth animations and transitions enhance the user experience, making the app visually appealing and engaging.  

## Development Process  

1. Designed and developed the portfolio using **React.js**.  
2. Deployed the app on an **AWS EC2 server** for robust hosting.  
3. Acquired a **custom domain** and redirected the EC2 server URL to the domain.  
4. Secured the app with an **SSL certificate** for HTTPS support.  
5. Configured **Nginx** as a reverse proxy and used **Node.js** to deploy the application.  
6. Integrated animations to achieve a smooth, modern, and professional look, showcasing my attention to design and functionality.  

## Purpose
