# Digital Portfolio

I have created a **Digital Portfolio** to showcase my skills, interests, hobbies, experiences, and work history. This project highlights my journey and growth throughout the years. 

The front end of the portfolio was built using **React.js**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **TypeScript**. Once I was satisfied with the design and functionality, I deployed the website using an **AWS EC2 server**, where I configured **Nginx** and **Node.js** to power the application.

To secure the website, I obtained an **SSL certificate**, ensuring safe and encrypted communication. I then set up a domain name, [mohammedbakhshi.com](https://mohammedbakhshi.com), and redirected the site from the EC2 server to this domain. Now, instead of using the EC2 server address to access my website, you can simply type in my domain name: 

➡️ **[mohammedbakhshi.com](https://mohammedbakhshi.com)**
